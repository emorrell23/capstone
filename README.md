Golf Course Recommender Capstone project for General Assembly Data Science Immersive

This repository is a for a golf course recommendation engine that I built while in the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly.

The goal of this project was to recommend similar golf courses to users given a known course that a user enjoys. Results were narrowed down to a 50 mile radius given a target zip code where you want to play. The overarching goal for this project was to help golfers to find new challenges that they might not otherwise ever discover.

Please read the Technical Report for a full breakdown on how I went about this. 

Even better, check out the notebook to see how this was created and to try it out for yourself!
